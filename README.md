# Fridgeslam, making poetry cool again


## Minimum Viable Product
Fridgeslam: inspired by the wordsmiths at Urban Dictionary, Fridgeslam is a place to express and show off your poetic side. If you are feeling like a solo artist, pick from randomly generated words as they come to compose your poetic slam. Or if, you are feeling more social, create a slam one-word-at-a-time with friends.
